The \textbf{sample space}, \textit{S}, is the set of all possible outcomes.
	\newline
	If a sample space contains a finite number of possibilities or an unending sequence with as many elements as there are whole numbers, it is called a \textbf{discrete sample space}.
	\newline
Example: When rolling a standard six-sided die form the discrete sample space, the possible outcomes are $S={1,2,3,4,5,6}$ 
 \newline

	If a sample space contains an infinite number of possibilities equal to the number of points on a line segment, it is called a \textbf{continuous sample space}.
	\break
Example: Measuring the heights of people in a population. This is a continuous sample space, because height can take any real value within a given range. 
	\newline
	An \textbf{event} is a subset, $A\subseteq S$, of the sample space. The event is the amount that contains all possible events.
	An example of a discrete event could be rolling a die and getting an uneven number, this would be the event $A={1,3,5}$.
	\newline 
For the continuous event, it could be that a person is between 160 cm and 170 cm tall.
\newline
	
    	The probability of an event \textit{A}, $P(A)$, is the sum of the weights of all sample points in \textit{A}.
	The probability of the whole sample space is 1, $P(S)=1$
	The  probability of any event being between 0 and 1,$0<P(A)<1$
	The probability of the empty set being 0, $P(Ø)=0$
	\newline
 	\newline
 	Probability of mutually exclusive events
  	\newline
	If \textit{A} and \textit{B} are mutually exclusive, $A \cap B=Ø$, then
 	\newline
	$P(A \cup B) = P(A)+P(B)$
 	\newline
  	\newline
	Where \textit{A} and \textit{B} never occur at the same time, so their union is equal to the two events added together. 
	\newline
	Probability of union
	\newline
	$P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)
	 \newline
	Here, the union of the two events is \textit{A} added to \textit{B}, but minus their common event, since it otherwise would be added twice. 
 	\newline
	Two events \textit{A} and \textit{B} are independent, if 
 	\newline
	$P(A|B)=P(A)$
 	\newline
	The equivalent definition to this is:
 	\newline
	Two events \textit{A} and \textit{B} are independent if and only if 
	\newline
	$P(A \cap B)=P(A)P(B)$
 	This says that the probability of both event \textit{A} and \textit{B} happening, is equal to the product of the two events.
